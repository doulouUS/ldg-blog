> Quick test of the eCharts javascript library and working with Jekyll.

In my blog posts, I want to be able to display data easily in a nice manner. I came across Apache ECharts which seems to do just that: easy syntax, beautiful renders, interactivity and lots of documented examples.

<div id="main" style="width: 600px;height:400px;"></div>
